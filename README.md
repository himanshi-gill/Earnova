#Earnova
#Description

Lets tell your kids that awards such as new items, toys and even pocket money are not for granted. They have to earn things by doing hard work, and their carelessness or mistakes can affect this progress.

The app is for children aged 7–12 years. This app helps in building habits in small children and letting them understand the importance of hard work and hard-earned things, along with the proud feeling they can experience through their achievements.

It is a gamified version so kids can enjoy the application with a competitive heart while learning responsibility at the same time.

* Kids log the tasks that their parents think are rewarding.
* They get 10+ points for each completed task.
